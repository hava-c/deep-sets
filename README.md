# Permutation-Invariant Neural Networks and Applications for Irregularly-shaped Time Series

Permutation-invariant neural networks are deep neural networks whose output is invariant to permutations of the input. Such net- works have received considerable attention recently, notably through the influential Deep Sets paper [1]. The goals of this project would be to first understand and implement the Deep Sets architecture, and try to use it to model time series. In particular, one of the advantages of using permutation-invariant architectures for time series is to be able to handle irregularly-sampled series, as demonstrated by the Set Functions for Time Series paper [2].

The file `Deep_sets.ipynb` can be opened using Google Colab where all necessary librairies and dependencies are available and ready to be used.
